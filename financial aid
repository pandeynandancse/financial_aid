Question : Why are you applying for Financial Aid? (150 words minimum required)

Answer : I belong to a not so financially stable family and now that the fees of coursera courses is too much, I can't afford to pay for them and this is the reason, I am applying for financial aid, my father is barely able to pay for college fees, how would he afford this extra fee, I don't earn even a single penny. Moreover I am from India, a economically less 
advanced country, and the fee is accordingly quite much. So, this is the reason I need financial aid. I am also saving a little for my higher education, as our government is not as supportive as United Kingdom's or United States's or Germany's, so we in India have to look up for our own so as to get educated, and in this process coursera is helping a lot, providing financial aids and giving certificates.
So kindly provide me financial aid as soon as possible.
Thank you
